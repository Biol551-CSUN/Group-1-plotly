## Introduction
Today, we will cover the "plotly" package and explore it using a variety of datasets. First, we will start by uploading the packages that will be needed today. If these packages do not load, be sure to install them.

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(readr)

```

This package can be used in a variety of ways to make data interactive and fun. The functions we will be exploring today are:
